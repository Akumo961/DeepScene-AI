DeepScene AI is a revolutionary tool that transforms text descriptions into complete virtual film scenes with AI-generated images, character analysis, mood detection, and dialogue generation.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎭 Scene Analysis
- **Genre Detection**: Automatically identifies scene genre (comedy, drama, horror, romance, action, thriller, musical)
- **Mood Analysis**: Detects emotional tone with confidence scoring
- **Character Extraction**: Identifies characters from scene descriptions
- **Setting Recognition**: Extracts locations and environments

### 🎨 AI Image Generation
- **FREE Local Generation**: Uses Stable Diffusion for completely free image creation
- **Multiple Fallbacks**: CPU-optimized, GPU-accelerated, and API backup options
- **Style-Aware Prompts**: Generates cinematic images based on scene style
- **Professional Quality**: High-resolution images suitable for storyboarding

### 💬 AI Dialogue Generation
- **Context-Aware**: Generates appropriate dialogue based on scene context
- **Character-Centric**: Creates dialogue that fits identified characters
- **Genre-Appropriate**: Tailors language to match scene genre

### 📊 Professional Output
- **JSON Exports**: Saves complete scene analysis for later use
- **Visual Storyboards**: Combines AI images with scene data
- **Logging**: Tracks all generated scenes and analyses

🔧 Configuration
AI Model Settings
The application uses these AI models by default:

Image Generation: Stable Diffusion v1.5 (runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5)

Text Processing: Custom rule-based systems with spaCy fallback

All models run locally - no API costs!

Performance Optimization
CPU Mode: Optimized for systems without GPU (2-5 minutes per image)

GPU Mode: Accelerated generation (30-60 seconds per image)

Memory Efficient: Automatic attention slicing and low-memory modes

🎨 Customization
Adding New Genres
Edit data/scene_templates.json to add new genres:

json
"fantasy": {
  "keywords": ["magic", "dragon", "kingdom", "wizard", "quest"],
  "style": "epic scale, mystical lighting, fantasy atmosphere",
  "mood": "wondrous, epic, magical"
}
Modifying Style Prompts
Update style templates in the data loader to change image generation aesthetics.

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Image generation fails:

bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate torch torchvision

# For CPU-only systems, use smaller models
# The app automatically detects and uses CPU-optimized mode
Out of memory errors:

The app includes automatic memory optimization

Use smaller image sizes in the configuration

Close other applications during generation

First run is slow:

Models download on first use (2-4GB)

Subsequent runs are much faster
